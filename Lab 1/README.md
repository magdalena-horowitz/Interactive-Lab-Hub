## Part A. Plan

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

Our original brainstorming storyboards center on an alarm clock that wakes up the user using a light of their choice. We wanted to be able to imitate a sunny wake up for users who live in dark, gloomy areas like Seattle or a relaxed, rainy day wake up for users who live in sunny areas like California. The idea is that no matter where a person lives, the alarm will imitate their desired wake up weather conditions.

Our intended users are academics and professionals who want to wake up in a healthy, non jarring way through light rather than sound. Additionally, our users are people who may not live in the ideal weather setting of their choice but want to mimic their ideal morning weather, whether it's a sunny, bright day or a cool, rainy day.

\*\***Include a picture of your storyboard here**\*\*

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
Our original idea was to simply wake up users with a bright white light. However, on examining this situation, we realized that a bright white light would be a jarring wakeup, almost as jarring as waking up with a loud noise which is the situation our users are trying to avoid. As a result, we changed our idea from a bright white light to colored lights of various intensities that would allow users to choose the intensity of their light wake up.

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it.

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

One issue we ran into when setting up this prototype was that the light source was not strong enough to wake someone up, especially if the device is set on a bedside table, similar to where an alarm clock normally is. To compensate, we decided to add more light sources around the room that would fill the room with the desired amount of light rather than having one, singular, weak light source.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*
Get a stronger light source ie: projecting the desired light throughout the room. This was hard to model with the prototype, but the end goal is the device has a projector feature that floods the room with the chosen light color and strength: such as a light purple all across the ceiling, walls, etc at a brightness of 100000 nits. This setting should be controlled and set by the user based on their preferences.
We also hope to include in future iterations an additional light signal after the user wakes up. This second light source will portray the temperature of the outside environment. Red for hot, green or purple for temperate, and blue for cold. The user will be able to customize his or her preferences: ie: Mayur thinks that above 50 F is actually really hot (whereas some people might think over 80F is hot)! So a red light will go on if it’s 51 degrees outside. This way, a user will know how the temperature is relative to his or her own preferences rather than regular temperature standards.

## Part C. Prototype the device

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

The tinkerbell application was not very compatible with the school wifi as the wifi sets up profiles and makes it so we cannot connect to tinkerbell through our phones without the use of a hotspot.

## Part D. Wizard the device

Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record.

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

See Video Version 1 for initial take.

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

See Video Version 2 for updated changes and follow-up work.

We made changes to the user interaction of the device and how bright our light source was. We also discussed potential options for showing the secondary source of light after the user wakes up indicating the temperature outside.

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

We wanted the user to have minimal interaction with the device and to have a pleasant experience waking up. By incorporating 3 buttons to select the lighting type, we reduce the complexity of the device and make the choice easier.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

# Staging Interaction, Part 2

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.

## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear.

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

- The light could have been stronger
- The light could be more customizable
- Consider the effects of light biologically on one's mood and sleep


Most of the feedback centered on concerns that the single light source was not enough to wake up users. People were unsure if they would actually be able to wake up with a single light alarm. Others wanted more customizability on the light - rather than only be able to use the light to mimic sunlight/cloudiness, maybe users should be able to pick light colors based on individual preferences and aethetics. For example, if a user had a pink bedroom and liked the color pink, they could choose a pink light to wake them up. 

Our original idea was to simply wake up users with a bright white light. However, on examining this situation, we realized that a bright white light would be a jarring wakeup, almost as jarring as waking up with a loud noise which is the situation our users are trying to avoid. As a result, we changed our idea from a bright white light to colored lights of various intensities that would allow users to choose the intensity of their light wake up. People were also concerned if they slept in a room with other people, the light alarm woudl wake everybody up. 

We wanted to keep the device as a single light source rather than expand to multiple lights that would fill a room. Accordingly, we changed out device from a bedside alarm to a light up sleep mask that would glow softly, not bldinging the user but keepng the light in their face such that it would wake the user up. A major concern here was to avoid blinding the user and shininign the light right in their face so we want to ensure the light is soft and glowing to avoid harming the user's eyes. Additionally, to account for the feedback regardig multiple people sleeping in a room, the eye mask lights would only affect the user themself and not affect other people in the room. 



## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time:

1. It doesn’t have to (just) use light,
3. You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
4. We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity.

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*


## Updates for Part 2:

### Features Added:

   - Vibration
    - Spotify Connection, option to add music
    - Eyemask integration - internal light glows from within and wakes the user up with a soft vibration and natural light that's programmable
